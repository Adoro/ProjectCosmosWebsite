# 30/12/2024: Launch of the Project Cosmos devblog

Hey everyone!

I’m super excited to announce that the Project Cosmos devblog is officially live! After a lot of planning and work behind the scenes, I’ve finally launched a space where I can share the journey of developing Project Cosmos with all of you.

The devblog will be the go-to place for updates, insights, and progress reports as I continue to work on this project. I’ve added some initial content to get things started, including a bit about the project itself, the technologies I’m using, and the vision behind it. But of course, this is just the beginning. There’s so much more I want to share, like the challenges I’m facing, the lessons I’m learning along the way, and maybe even some sneak peeks into the features and game mechanics I’m developing.

Stay tuned for more updates soon!
