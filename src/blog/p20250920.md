Just a small note on where I’m at with Project Cosmos.
I’ve set up Steam integration, which already feels like a big step forward. Along the way I also rebuilt a small framework around raylib to keep things simple and give me a solid base to build on.

I’ve also been thinking a lot about the art style—trying out new ideas that might better capture the mood I want for the game. Still early, but it’s starting to click.

That’s it for now. Just putting this out there.
