# Website

The inspiration for Project Cosmos came from reading Carl Sagan's renowned book Cosmos. In his work, Sagan explores the vastness of the universe and highlights key moments in human history when significant scientific discoveries and breakthroughs reshaped our understanding of the cosmos. He weaves together stories of scientific pioneers, revolutionary ideas, and pivotal moments in time that have contributed to our current knowledge of space, science, and technology. These narratives, spanning different times and places, sparked the idea for a project that would allow people to explore and visualize these breakthroughs in a more interactive and engaging way.

I envisioned creating a website that serves as a dynamic platform for users to explore an interactive timeline of humanity’s most groundbreaking discoveries. The website would allow visitors to travel through time, discovering the stories behind major scientific advancements and the people who made them possible. The goal is to offer an educational tool that not only chronicles historical events but also illustrates how these discoveries are interconnected, showing the progression of human understanding of the universe.

Currently, the website is still under development, but the concept is taking shape. I’m working hard to bring it to life, with plans to feature a variety of interactive elements, such as clickable timelines, detailed descriptions, and visual representations of key events in science. I hope to launch the platform soon, providing a rich resource for anyone curious about the history of science and space exploration.
