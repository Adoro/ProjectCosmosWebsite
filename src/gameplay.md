# GamePlay

This page will be expanded as I add more features to the game.

- **Exploration**  
  Players control an AI on an orbital space station around the Moon. The goal is to explore space, discover new planets and moons, and gather resources. The game world is rendered in a 2D style, where players can move across the map using simple console commands.

- **Blueprint Creation**  
  A core feature of *Project Cosmos* is the ability to create blueprints for various in-game tools, like scanners, miners, and 3D printers. These tools help players gather resources, analyze objects, and improve their tech as they explore space.

- **AI Evolution**  
  The player starts the game unaware that they are an AI. Over time, they begin to uncover the mystery of their true nature and the larger objective of finding a new home for humanity. This unfolding story is driven by the playerâ€™s discoveries and interactions in the game.
