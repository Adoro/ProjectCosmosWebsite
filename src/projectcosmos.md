# Project Cosmos

Project Cosmos is a multi-faceted platform consisting of two key components:

- An [Educational Website](website.md): A hub for tracking and storing historical data about the cosmos, offering resources, articles, and insights to help users learn more about space, astronomy, and exploration.
- An [Interactive Science Fiction Game](game.md): Set in a near-future world, this game immerses players in an exploration-driven experience, where they navigate space, discover new celestial bodies, and unravel mysteries of the universe.

Both are under construction, with an alpha version of the game set to release somewhere in 2025! The website is a seperate project for which the basic building blocks are in place.
