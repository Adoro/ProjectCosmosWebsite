# Nero: My Custom C++ OpenGL 2D Game Engine

Nero is a game engine I developed from the ground up, using C++ and OpenGL. It's tailored specifically for my own projects, providing a lightweight and efficient framework for 2D game development. I built it to have complete control over the rendering pipeline, input management, and physics, giving me the flexibility I need to create unique gaming experiences. Nero is designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing me to focus on game design without relying too much on external libraries or frameworks. Itâ€™s the engine I use to bring my personal game projects to life.
