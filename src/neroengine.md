# Nero Engine: My Custom C++ OpenGL 2D Game Engine

Nero Engine is a game engine I developed from the ground up, using C++ and OpenGL. It's tailored specifically for my own projects, providing a lightweight and efficient framework for 2D game development. I built it to have complete control over the rendering pipeline, input management, external libraries used, and physics, giving me the flexibility I need to create specific gameplay. Nero is designed to be simple yet powerful, allowing me to focus on game design without relying on large game engines like Unity or Unreal, keeping the development process straightforward and simple. 

I started working on Nero in 2020 as a hobby project to learn more about how game engine systems work in Unity and Unreal. Over time, it became a valuable learning experience, helping me deepen my understanding of game development and low-level systems. Today, itâ€™s the engine I use to bring my personal game projects to life.
