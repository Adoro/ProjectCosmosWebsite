# Dear ImGUI

Dear ImGui has become the go-to choice for creating in-game graphical user interfaces, and it’s easy to see why. Nearly every major game engine and game studio uses it in some capacity, whether for debugging tools, editors, or even core game interfaces. Its immediate mode GUI (IMGUI) paradigm allows for fast and efficient creation of interactive elements, making it a perfect fit for developers who need quick feedback and iterative testing.

After seeing its widespread adoption in the industry, I decided to incorporate Dear ImGui as the core GUI interface for my engine. Initially, I intended to use it only for debugging purposes, as it’s incredibly useful for quickly displaying information, adjusting parameters, or testing features during development. However, as I worked with it more, I realized its potential beyond debugging. Its simple API, flexibility, and ability to create fully functional and interactive interfaces made it an ideal choice for more complex user interfaces within the game itself. Now, Dear ImGui serves as the foundation for the game's GUI, providing tools for menus, options, and interactive systems—all with the same ease and speed that makes it a favorite among developers.
