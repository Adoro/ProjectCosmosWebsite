# GLM

GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) has been an indispensable part of this project, and without it, much of what I’ve built would have been nearly impossible. As a C++-based math library tailored for graphics programming, GLM provides all the essential mathematical functions and structures needed for handling transformations, matrices, vectors, and quaternions—critical components for any graphics-intensive project. Its syntax is clean and intuitive, aligning closely with GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), making it seamless to integrate into my engine.

From the very beginning, GLM became the backbone of the engine’s rendering pipeline. Whether it was for handling camera projections, performing transformations on 2D objects, or dealing with complex vector mathematics, GLM made these tasks straightforward and efficient. Without it, I would have had to implement many of these mathematical functions from scratch, which would have been time-consuming and error-prone. In a project like this, where precision and performance are key, GLM’s reliable and optimized functions have been vital to maintaining the engine’s integrity. It’s clear that this project would not have been feasible without GLM, and it’s become a core part of the foundation on which everything else is built.
